            Wow! You're pretty good at this! I'm impressed at how far you've come but there is one more level and I'm not going to make it easy. In the next level I will give you a text to read. Read it over a few times and make sure you remember EVERYTHING. You will then get asked quetions about the text and if you get a single one wrong you will die. There is no time limit for the time you can spend reading the text so take your time. Once you start the questions you can't go back to the text.
