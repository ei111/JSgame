            <br>
            Welcome to the first level! We're going to start off easy! For the first level it will be mulitple choice. There will be 5 multiple choices questions, but you have to be careful because if you get a single one wrong you will die and have to restart. To select your answer click on the word. If the first level is a bit easy, don't worry the futher you go in the game the harder it gets. There is also a time limit so be careful not to take too long!
