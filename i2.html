            Welcome to the second level! Congrats on making it to here. Did you find the first few quests a bit easy? Well don't worry i'll make it a whole lot harder in a minute. There will be 3 questions in the next level. All of them will give you a definition and then you will choose which type of Zionism it describes. Just like last time you have to be careful because if you get a single one wrong you will die and have to restart. And just like last time you have to be quick because of the time limit!
